# HazardHawk Image Orientation and Watermark Testing Manual

## Overview
This manual provides comprehensive testing procedures for validating image orientation handling and watermark consistency in HazardHawk. These tests ensure photos are saved in the correct orientation and watermarks are consistently sized across all devices and scenarios.

## Testing Scope

### Critical Test Areas
1. **Orientation Preservation** - Photos maintain correct orientation from capture to storage
2. **Watermark Consistency** - Text and positioning remain consistent across device rotations
3. **Aspect Ratio Handling** - Images are cropped correctly for different viewfinder settings
4. **Cross-Device Compatibility** - Consistent behavior across Android versions and manufacturers
5. **Performance Impact** - Processing doesn't significantly impact app performance

## Manual Testing Protocols

### Protocol 1: Basic Orientation Validation

**Objective:** Verify photos are saved with correct orientation regardless of device rotation

**Prerequisites:**

   - Open HazardHawk camera
   - Take photo of a scene with clear orientation markers (text, signs, people)
   - Navigate to Gallery and verify photo appears correctly oriented
   - Share photo to external app and verify orientation is preserved
   - **Expected:** Photo appears upright in all contexts

2. **Portrait Device, Landscape Photo**
   - Hold device in portrait orientation  
   - Rotate viewfinder to landscape mode (if available)
   - Take photo of landscape scene
   - Verify photo orientation in Gallery and external sharing
   - **Expected:** Photo appears correctly oriented for landscape content

3. **Landscape Device, Portrait Photo**
   - Rotate device to landscape orientation
   - Take photo of portrait scene (person, tall building)
   - Check photo orientation in Gallery
   - **Expected:** Photo content appears upright despite device rotation

4. **Landscape Device, Landscape Photo**
   - Hold device in landscape orientation
   - Take photo of wide landscape scene
   - Verify orientation consistency
   - **Expected:** Photo matches expected landscape orientation

**Pass Criteria:**
- All photos appear correctly oriented in Gallery
- External sharing preserves orientation
- No photos appear rotated incorrectly

### Protocol 2: Watermark Consistency Testing

**Objective:** Ensure watermark text size and positioning remain consistent across orientations

**Test Steps:**

1. **Watermark Size Consistency**
   - Take photos in portrait and landscape orientations
   - Compare watermark text size relative to image dimensions
   - Measure watermark height as percentage of image height
   - **Expected:** Text size scales proportionally with image dimensions

2. **Watermark Positioning**
   - Verify watermark always appears at bottom of image
   - Check padding from edges is consistent
   - Ensure watermark doesn't obscure important image content
   - **Expected:** Bottom-aligned positioning with consistent margins

3. **Watermark Readability**
   - Test on various background colors and patterns
   - Verify white text with shadow remains readable
   - Check contrast in different lighting conditions
   - **Expected:** Text remains clearly readable in all scenarios

4. **Multi-line Content**
   - Configure project with long name to test text wrapping
   - Add lengthy GPS address information
   - Verify multiple lines display correctly

### Protocol 3: Aspect Ratio Validation

**Objective:** Verify aspect ratio settings are applied correctly during capture

**Test Steps:**

1. **4:3 Aspect Ratio**
   - Set viewfinder to 4:3 aspect ratio
   - Take photos in both portrait and landscape device orientations
   - Verify saved photos match 4:3 ratio (±0.05 tolerance)
   - **Expected:** Photos have 1.33:1 aspect ratio

2. **16:9 Aspect Ratio**
   - Set viewfinder to 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Capture in both orientations
   - Verify saved photos match 16:9 ratio (±0.05 tolerance)
   - **Expected:** Photos have 1.78:1 aspect ratio

3. **1:1 Square Aspect Ratio**
   - Set viewfinder to square (1:1) aspect ratio
   - Take photos in both orientations
   - Verify saved photos are perfectly square
   - **Expected:** Photos have 1:1 aspect ratio exactly

4. **Aspect Ratio Cropping**
   - Compare viewfinder preview to saved image
   - Ensure saved photo matches what was visible in viewfinder
   - Check for unexpected cropping or letterboxing
   - **Expected:** Saved image matches viewfinder preview exactly

**Pass Criteria:**
- All aspect ratios are within tolerance limits
- Saved images match viewfinder preview
- No unexpected cropping occurs
- Orientation doesn't affect aspect ratio accuracy
