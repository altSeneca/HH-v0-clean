## 🧠 Key Decisions & Context

### **Technical Decisions Made**

#### 1. **Architecture Pattern Choice**
- **Decision:** Extracted handler classes instead of keeping nested functions
- **Rationale:** Improved testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns
- **Impact:** Reduced main composable from 730+ lines to ~200 lines

#### 2. **State Management Approach**
- **Decision:** Centralized dialog state in `GalleryDialogState` class
- **Rationale:** Eliminated 10+ scattered state variables, improved type safety
- **Impact:** Easier to maintain and test state transitions

#### 3. **UI Component Organization**
- **Decision:** Created separate files for major UI components
- **Rationale:** Following existing codebase patterns (like `CameraScreen.kt`)
- **Impact:** Better code organization and reusability

#### 4. **Construction Worker UX Preservation**
- **Decision:** Maintained all existing construction-friendly optimizations
- **Rationale:** Core user base requires glove-friendly, high-contrast interface
- **Impact:** No regression in field usability

### **Implementation Constraints**
1. **Existing Architecture:** Must integrate with current `GalleryViewModel` and `ProjectManager`
2. **Construction UX Requirements:** Large touch targets (≥56dp), high contrast colors, haptic feedback
3. **Memory Efficiency:** Handle large photo collections without performance degradation
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Code structure supports future iOS/Desktop expansion

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Incremental Development:** Implemented features step-by-step with testing at each phase
2. **Fallback Patterns:** Maintained existing functionality while adding enhancements
3. **Construction Testing:** Preserved all construction-worker optimization patterns
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Used existing performance testing framework
