# OSHA 1926 Construction Standards Complete Analysis and Tag Catalog Design

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis of OSHA 1926 construction standards provides the foundation for HazardHawk's intelligent tag catalog system. The research reveals 27 subparts covering all construction safety aspects, identifies the most critical violation patterns, and establishes a data-driven framework for construction workers to efficiently tag and analyze safety hazards in the field.

**Key Findings:**
- Fall protection violations lead OSHA citations for 14 consecutive years (5,424 violations in FY2024)
- The "Fatal Four" hazards account for 60% of construction deaths but represent only 31.5% of workplace fatalities

```

### 5.2 AI Tag Recommendation Algorithm

#### Multi-Factor Scoring System
```python
def calculate_tag_relevance_score(tag, context):
    base_score = tag.usage_frequency * 0.3
    seasonal_score = tag.seasonal_weight * get_seasonal_factor() * 0.2
    activity_score = get_activity_match_score(tag, context.project_type) * 0.25
    user_history_score = get_user_preference_score(tag, context.user) * 0.15
    safety_priority_score = get_enforcement_priority_weight(tag) * 0.1
    
    return min(1.0, base_score + seasonal_score + activity_score + 
               user_history_score + safety_priority_score)
```

#### Contextual Triggering Rules
