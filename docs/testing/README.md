## Quick Reference

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd HazardHawk
./gradlew :shared:test :shared:integrationTest
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
./gradlew :shared:test :shared:jacocoTestReport
open HazardHawk/shared/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
```

### Start Test Services
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
```

---

## Test Infrastructure

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/phase2-tests.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop/feature, Pull requests
- **Jobs**: Unit tests, Integration tests, E2E tests, Performance tests
- **Reports**: Uploaded as artifacts, coverage to Codecov

### Localstack (AWS Emulation)
- **Purpose**: S3, SES, SNS, SQS testing without AWS costs
- **Endpoint**: http://localhost:4566
- **Setup**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d localstack`
- **Init Script**: `scripts/localstack-init.sh`

### Mock Infrastructure
- **Location**: `/HazardHawk/shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/hazardhawk/data/mocks/`
- **Components**:
  - `MockApiClient.kt` - HTTP client mocking
  - `MockS3Client.kt` - S3 upload/download mocking
  - `MockOCRClient.kt` - Document AI mocking
  - `MockNotificationClient.kt` - Email/SMS/Push mocking
  - `MockApiResponses.kt` - Sample JSON responses

### Test Fixtures
- **Location**: `/HazardHawk/shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/hazardhawk/fixtures/`
- **Contents**: TestFixtures.kt with sample data for:
  - Certifications (OSHA 10, OSHA 30, CPR, First Aid)
  - Crew/Workers (laborers, supervisors, foremen)
  - Projects (construction, roadwork)
  - Dashboard metrics
  - Test images (base64 encoded)

---

## Test Coverage Targets

### By Module
- **Shared Module**: 85%+ (all services, repositories)
- **Domain Layer**: 90%+ (business logic)
- **Data Layer**: 80%+ (API clients, caching)
- **Android App**: 75%+ (UI ViewModels)

### By Component
- **FileUploadService**: 30 tests (compression, retry logic, progress)
- **OCRService**: 40 tests (extraction accuracy, confidence handling)
- **NotificationService**: 15 tests (email, SMS, push)
- **Repositories**: 25 tests (CRUD, caching, error handling)

---

## Quality Gates

Phase 2 testing includes 7 quality gates:

1. **Week 1**: Foundation layer approval (20+ tests)
2. **Week 2**: Service integration phase 1 (90+ tests)
3. **Week 3**: Service integration phase 2 (150+ tests)
4. **Week 4 Day 1**: Integration testing (15 tests, 100% pass)
5. **Week 4 Day 2**: E2E testing (10 tests, 100% pass)
6. **Week 4 Day 3**: Performance testing (targets met)
7. **Week 4 Day 4**: Canary rollout (<1% error rate)

**Failure Protocol**: If any gate fails, halt progression and fix issues.

## CRITICAL ALERT: Week 4 Day 1 Gate FAILED

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL - BUILD FAILURE**  
**Impact**: All Phase 2 Week 4 work BLOCKED

### Issue Summary
Integration testing gate **FAILED** with 786 compilation errors preventing all test execution. Zero tests could run to validate Week 3 claims of 138 tests.

### Root Cause
Dual shared module architecture:
- `/shared` (root) - Contains FeatureFlags.kt
- `/HazardHawk/shared` - Phase 2 code cannot import from root

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **STOP** all Week 4 development
2. Fix module architecture (P0 - refactor-master)
3. Fix model imports (P0 - simple-architect)
4. Re-run integration gate (P1 - test-guardian)

### Full Report
See: [Integration Testing Gate FAIL Report](../implementation/phase2/gates/gate-integration-testing-FAIL.md)

### Next Steps
- Pause Phase 2 Week 4 activities
- Execute fixes per Action 1-2 in gate report
- Re-validate all 138 claimed tests after compilation fixes

**DO NOT PROCEED** with Week 4 until gate re-run shows PASS.
