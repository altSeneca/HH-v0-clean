#### Status: ✅ Complete

### Phase 3: Issue-Specific Implementations (10:57 - 11:15 AM)

#### Issue 1: Photo Storage Path Inconsistency

**Problem:** Camera saved photos to different directory than gallery read from.

**Files Modified:**
- `CameraGalleryActivity.kt` (Lines 164-176, 15)
- `CameraScreen.kt` (Lines 1584-1599, 1616-1638)  
- `MainActivity.kt` (Lines 114-119, 30)

**Key Changes:**
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Inconsistent paths
// Camera: context.getExternalFilesDir(null)/HazardHawk/Photos
// Gallery: context.getExternalFilesDir(DIRECTORY_PICTURES)/HazardHawk

// AFTER: Unified path via PhotoStorageManagerCompat
val photos = PhotoStorageManagerCompat.getAllPhotos(this)
val saveResult = PhotoStorageManagerCompat.savePhotoWithResult(context, photoFile)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Immediate photo visibility in gallery
- ✅ Robust error handling with Result types
- ✅ MediaStore integration for system gallery
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

**Testing:** Photo capture → gallery flow validated  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### Issue 2: Viewfinder Portrait Orientation Calculations  

**Problem:** Aspect ratio calculations produced incorrect dimensions in portrait mode.

**Files Modified:**
- `camera/ViewfinderOverlay.kt` (Major refactor with centralized calculations)
- `CameraScreen.kt` (Multiple viewfinder overlay fixes)

**Mathematical Fix:**
```kotlin
// NEW: Centralized calculation function
private fun calculateViewfinderDimensions(
    canvasWidth: Float,
    canvasHeight: Float,
    targetRatio: Float,
    widthMarginFactor: Float = 0.95f,
    heightMarginFactor: Float = 0.8f
): Pair<Float, Float>

// BEFORE: Landscape-only logic caused portrait issues
// AFTER: Orientation-aware constraint selection
val isPortraitScreen = canvasHeight > canvasWidth
val adjustedCanvasWidth = canvasWidth * widthMarginFactor  
val adjustedCanvasHeight = canvasHeight * heightMarginFactor
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Portrait/landscape orientation detection
- ✅ Proper constraint selection (width vs height)
- ✅ Configurable margin factors (95% width, 80% height)
- ✅ Centralized logic eliminating code duplication
- ✅ Boundary validation preventing screen overflow

**Aspect Ratio Validation:**
- 1:1 (Square) → Perfect squares in both orientations
- 4:3 (Standard) → Correct landscape rectangle in portrait mode
- 16:9 (Widescreen) → Correct wide rectangle in portrait mode

**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### Issue 3: Settings Drawer Layout Instability

**Problem:** Fixed offset positioning caused icon movement during drawer animations.

**Files Modified:**
- `CameraScreen.kt` (Lines 781-802, 724-732, 869-873)
- `MainActivity.kt` (Line 107 - removed deprecated parameter)

**Layout Architecture Fix:**
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Fixed offset causing instability
.offset(y = (-96).dp) // Absolute positioning

// AFTER: Constraint-based layout
Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .wrapContentHeight(),
    contentAlignment = Alignment.BottomCenter
) {
    AnimatedVisibility(
        modifier = Modifier.padding(bottom = 80.dp) // Reserved space
    )
}
```

**Enhancements Added:**
- ✅ Backdrop tap-to-dismiss functionality
- ✅ Reserved space preventing content reflow
- ✅ Smooth constraint-based animations
- ✅ Stable gallery/capture/settings button positioning

**User Experience Improvements:**
- No unexpected UI movement during drawer operations
- Intuitive tap-outside-to-close behavior
- Maintained construction-friendly design (large touch targets)
- Professional animation timing and easing

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Phase 4: UI Component Enforcement (11:10 - 11:15 AM)

#### Design Consistency Monitoring

#### Component Violations Identified
- **ReportGenerationDialogs.kt:** 25+ Material3 component violations
- **Multiple files:** Need HazardHawk component library standardization
- **Priority:** Medium (future enhancement, not blocking current fixes)

#### Recommendations for Future
1. Create `HazardHawkTextField`, `HazardHawkDialog`, `HazardHawkButton` components
2. Implement component usage validation
3. Standardize error handling components

1. **Photo Capture Flow:**
   - Capture photo → immediately check gallery → verify photo appears
   - Test on multiple photo sizes (1MB, 5MB, 10MB+)
   - Rapid capture sequences (5+ photos quickly)

2. **Viewfinder Alignment:**
   - Test all aspect ratios (1:1, 4:3, 16:9) in portrait mode
   - Capture photos and verify overlay matches actual photo boundaries
   - Test orientation changes during camera usage

3. **Settings Drawer:**
   - Open/close drawer multiple times rapidly
   - Verify gallery/capture buttons never move
   - Test backdrop tap-to-dismiss functionality

### Test Devices Recommended
- **Primary:** Samsung Galaxy series (construction worker popular choice)
- **Secondary:** Google Pixel series (camera API reference)
- **Edge Case:** Older devices (API 26+) for backwards compatibility
