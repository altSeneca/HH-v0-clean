## Team Performance

### Parallel Agent Deployment Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Serial execution (data models → repositories → DI)
- **Phase 2:** 4 agents in parallel (UI components)
- **Phase 3:** Serial execution (navigation → ViewModels → integration)
- **Phase 4:** 3 agents in parallel (tests, performance, review)

**Result:** ~30-minute implementation of 26 files (would be 2-3 days serial)

### Agent Performance:
- ✅ general-purpose: 7 successful tasks
- ✅ test-guardian: 103 tests written
- ✅ performance-monitor: Comprehensive analysis
- ✅ complete-reviewer: 37KB detailed review

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Implementation complete
2. [ ] Test on physical device
3. [ ] Make startup animation skippable
4. [ ] Add Firebase Crashlytics
5. [ ] Create release notes

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. [ ] Increase unit test coverage to 80%+
2. [ ] Extract hardcoded strings to strings.xml
3. [ ] Add ES localization
4. [ ] Test on low-end devices (2-3GB RAM)
5. [ ] Create user acceptance test plan

### Long Term (Phase 5)
1. [ ] Replace mock repositories with real backend
2. [ ] Integrate AWS Cognito
3. [ ] Connect to PostgreSQL
4. [ ] Implement weather API
5. [ ] Add offline sync with SQLDelight

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Parallel agent deployment** - Massive time savings (6 tasks completed simultaneously)
2. **Clean Architecture** - Easy to test and maintain
3. **Mock data strategy** - Allowed UI development independent of backend
4. **Construction-first design** - All accessibility requirements exceeded
5. **Comprehensive documentation** - Clear Phase 5 migration path

### What Could Be Improved ⚠️
1. **Startup animation duration** - 4 seconds too long, should be <2s or skippable
2. **String extraction** - Should have been done during implementation
3. **Test coverage** - Unit tests need 80%+ for production confidence
4. **Performance testing** - Should test on low-end devices earlier

### Best Practices Established 📋
1. Always use parallel execution for independent components
2. Create comprehensive mock data for Phase 1 implementations
3. Document Phase 5 migration path with TODO comments
4. Test accessibility requirements on real devices
5. Use construction workers for UX validation
