## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### **State Management Enhancement**
```kotlin
// Before: Manual state checking scattered across components
// After: Centralized lifecycle-aware state management

class AppStateManager {
    override fun onStart(owner: LifecycleOwner) {
        validatePersistedState()
    }

    private fun validatePersistedState() {
        // Automatic state validation and routing
        // Handles first launch, corruption, and restoration
    }
}
```

### **Auto-fade Intelligence**
```kotlin
// Before: Fixed 5-second timer causing frustration
LaunchedEffect(lastInteractionTime, showControls, hasInitialDelayPassed) {
    delay(5000) // Fixed delay - PROBLEM!
    showControls = false
}

// After: Interaction-aware responsive system
LaunchedEffect(lastInteractionTime, showControls, hasInitialDelayPassed, userIsInteracting) {
    if (!userIsInteracting) {
        val fadeDelay = if (lastInteractionTime == 0L) 8000L else 4000L
        delay(fadeDelay)
        if (!userIsInteracting) showControls = false
    }
}
```

### **Design System Consolidation**
```kotlin
// Before: 6+ different button patterns
FloatingActionButton(...) // Various sizes and colors
Button(...) // Inconsistent styling
FilterChip(...) // Different patterns
CustomButtons(...) // Manual implementations

// After: Unified construction-optimized components
ConstructionPrimaryButton(size = ButtonSize.LARGE) // 72dp touch targets
ConstructionIconButton(size = ButtonSize.LARGE) // Consistent styling
ConstructionToggleButton() // Standard interaction patterns
```

### **Project Dropdown Simplification**
```kotlin
// Before: 925+ lines of complex custom implementation
// - Manual state management
// - Complex animation logic
// - Nested dialogs
// - Custom layout calculations

// After: 40 lines of Material 3 standard component
@Composable
fun ProjectDropdownCard(...) {
    ExposedDropdownMenuBox(...) {
        OutlinedTextField(readOnly = true, ...)
        ExposedDropdownMenu(...) {
            projects.forEach { project ->
                DropdownMenuItem(...)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
