6. Implement conflict detection algorithm

### For UI Team
1. Create attendance tracking UI (check-in/check-out buttons)
2. Create analytics dashboard
3. Create performance metrics charts
4. Create multi-project assignment UI
5. Create availability calendar view
6. Create conflict detection alerts

### For Testing Team
