### Problem Section

Even experienced safety professionals miss critical hazards. Fatigue, distractions, and human oversight put workers at risk.

**üìã Documentation Nightmare**
Handwritten reports, lost photos, and inconsistent documentation create compliance headaches and legal vulnerabilities.

**üí∞ Costly Violations**
OSHA citations average $15,625 per violation. A single missed hazard can cost more than years of safety software.
