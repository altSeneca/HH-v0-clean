# HazardHawk Glass UI - Quality Gates & Validation Framework

**Created:** September 11, 2025  
**Framework Version:** 1.0

## 🏗️ Quality Gate Architecture

### Multi-Layered Validation System
Our quality assurance strategy implements **four sequential quality gates** with increasing rigor, ensuring that issues are caught early and resolved before they impact later stages.

### Gate Hierarchy
```
Pre-Development → Gate 1 → Gate 2 → Gate 3 → Gate 4 → Production
    ↓               ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
 Planning      Foundation   Core Impl Integration Production
                                                    Ready
```
