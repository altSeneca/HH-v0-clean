## 🚨 Risk Management & Rollback Strategies

### High-Risk Scenarios & Mitigation

#### Risk 1: Dependency Hell (Probability: High, Impact: Critical)
**Scenario:** Conflicting versions prevent compilation  
**Mitigation:**
- Maintain dependency isolation branches
- Automated compatibility testing
- Pre-approved dependency matrix
- Emergency rollback to known good state (< 1 hour)

**Rollback Procedure:**
```bash
# Immediate rollback to known good dependencies
git checkout dependency-lock-baseline
./gradlew clean build
# If successful, create new baseline
git tag "dependencies-stable-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
```

#### Risk 2: Performance Degradation (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
**Scenario:** Glass effects cause significant performance impact  
**Mitigation:**
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Device capability detection
- Automatic fallback mechanisms
- Performance regression alerts

**Rollback Procedure:**
```kotlin
// Emergency performance fallback
if (performanceMonitor.averageFrameTime > 20f) {
    glassConfig = GlassConfig.Emergency // Solid OSHA fallbacks
    logger.warn("Performance degradation detected, switching to emergency mode")
}
```

#### Risk 3: Agent Coordination Conflicts (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)
**Scenario:** Multiple agents modify same files causing merge conflicts  
**Mitigation:**
- File ownership matrix
- Automatic merge conflict detection
- Agent-specific branches with controlled merges
- Real-time coordination status updates

**Conflict Resolution:**
1. Automatic detection via git hooks
2. Immediate agent notification
3. Coordination meeting within 30 minutes
4. Resolution by designated conflict owner
5. Merge approval by complete-reviewer

### Emergency Protocols

#### Code Red: Critical Compilation Failure
1. **Immediate Response (< 5 minutes):**
   - All agents stop current work
   - Rollback to last known good state
   - Root cause analysis initiated

2. **Recovery Process (< 30 minutes):**
   - Identify breaking change
   - Create isolated fix branch
   - Test fix in isolation
   - Coordinated merge when validated

3. **Prevention Updates:**
   - Update automated testing
   - Enhance pre-commit hooks
   - Revise coordination protocols
