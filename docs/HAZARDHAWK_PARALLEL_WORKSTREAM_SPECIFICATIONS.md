# HazardHawk Glass UI - Parallel Workstream Specifications

**Created:** September 11, 2025  
**Project Orchestrator:** Claude Code  
**Coordination Model:** Multi-Agent Parallel Execution  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Workstream Architecture Overview

### Core Principle: Intelligent Parallelization
Instead of sequential development, we're implementing **intelligent parallel workstreams** where specialized agents work simultaneously on different aspects while maintaining strict coordination protocols to prevent conflicts.

### Workstream Isolation Strategy
Each workstream operates in **isolated development bubbles** with controlled integration points, allowing maximum parallel efficiency while maintaining code quality and architectural coherence.

## ðŸš¨ Conflict Prevention & Resolution

### File Ownership Matrix
**Preventing merge conflicts through clear ownership boundaries:**

| File/Directory Pattern | Primary Owner | Secondary Access | Approval Required |
|------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `/gradle/libs.versions.toml` | simple-architect | All (read-only) | simple-architect |
| `/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/*/glass/` | loveable-ux | complete-reviewer | loveable-ux |
| `/androidApp/src/main/java/*/ui/glass/` | loveable-ux | refactor-master | Both agents |
| `/build.gradle.kts` | simple-architect | refactor-master | simple-architect |
| Test files (`*Test.kt`) | complete-reviewer | Test authors | complete-reviewer |
| Performance configs | refactor-master | simple-architect | Both agents |

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

#### Level 1: Automatic Resolution (0-5 minutes)
- Git hooks detect potential conflicts before commit
- Automated merge conflict resolution for simple cases
- Immediate notification to affected agents

#### Level 2: Agent Coordination (5-30 minutes)
- Affected agents join conflict resolution meeting
- Technical decision made by primary owner
- Solution implementation and validation
- Merge approval by secondary reviewer

#### Level 3: Escalation (30+ minutes)
- Project Orchestrator intervention
- Multi-agent architecture review
- Decision documentation for future reference
- Process improvement recommendations

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Pre-emptive Conflict Prevention
```bash
# Daily conflict detection script (runs every 2 hours)
#!/bin/bash
git fetch origin
for branch in simple-architect loveable-ux complete-reviewer refactor-master; do
    git merge-tree $(git merge-base origin/main origin/$branch) origin/main origin/$branch
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "ALERT: Potential conflict detected in $branch"
        # Trigger agent notification
    fi
done
```

#### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Emergency rollback to last stable state
git checkout main
git reset --hard last-stable-checkpoint-$(date -d "1 day ago" +%Y%m%d)
./gradlew clean build
# Notify all agents of rollback event
```

## ðŸ“Š Workstream Performance Metrics

### Parallel Efficiency Measurement
**Target:** 75% parallel efficiency (vs sequential development)

#### Efficiency Calculation
```
Parallel Efficiency = (Sequential Time - Parallel Time) / Sequential Time

Sequential Estimate: 35 days (140 hours)
Parallel Target: 26 days (104 hours)  
Target Efficiency: (140-104)/140 = 25.7% time savings
```

#### Real-time Efficiency Tracking
- **Daily throughput measurement** - Story points completed per agent
- **Coordination overhead tracking** - Time spent in sync meetings vs development
- **Rework minimization** - Percentage of code that survives integration
- **Quality maintenance** - Defect rate compared to sequential development

### Workstream Health Indicators

#### Green (Optimal Performance)
- Daily delivery targets met or exceeded
- <10% coordination overhead
- <5% integration rework required
- Zero critical blockers

#### Yellow (Attention Required)  
- 80-99% of daily targets met
- 10-20% coordination overhead
- 5-15% integration rework required
- 1-2 non-critical blockers

#### Red (Intervention Required)
- <80% of daily targets met
- >20% coordination overhead
- >15% integration rework required
- 3+ blockers or 1+ critical blocker

## ðŸŽ¯ Workstream Integration Strategies

### Continuous Integration Pipeline
**Each workstream maintains its own CI/CD with integration checkpoints:**

#### Agent-Specific Pipelines
```yaml
simple-architect:
  triggers: [dependency-updates, architecture-changes]
  validations: [build-success, api-compatibility, cross-platform]
  
loveable-ux:
  triggers: [glass-component-changes, ui-updates]  
  validations: [visual-regression, performance-impact, accessibility]
  
complete-reviewer:
  triggers: [any-code-change]
  validations: [quality-gates, security-scan, compliance-check]
  
refactor-master:
  triggers: [performance-sensitive-changes]
  validations: [benchmark-tests, memory-leaks, battery-impact]
```

#### Integration Pipeline
```yaml
integration:
  triggers: [workstream-milestone-completion]
  process:
    - merge-all-workstreams
    - run-integration-tests  
    - validate-performance-targets
    - security-penetration-testing
    - user-acceptance-testing
  approval: [complete-reviewer, simple-architect]
```

### Component Integration Matrix
**Ensuring clean interfaces between workstream outputs:**

| Component | Provider | Consumer | Interface Contract |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Glass API | simple-architect | loveable-ux | Type-safe Kotlin interfaces |
| Glass Components | loveable-ux | All screens | Composable function contracts |
| Performance Monitoring | refactor-master | All components | Metrics collection interfaces |
| Quality Standards | complete-reviewer | All agents | Linting rules and checks |

## ðŸ”® Success Prediction & Early Warning

### Predictive Analytics
**Using historical data and current metrics to predict workstream success:**

#### Success Probability Calculation
```kotlin
data class WorkstreamHealth(
    val dailyVelocity: Double,
    val qualityScore: Double,  
    val coordinationEfficiency: Double,
    val blockerImpact: Double
)

fun calculateSuccessProbability(health: WorkstreamHealth): Double {
    return (health.dailyVelocity * 0.4 + 
            health.qualityScore * 0.3 +
            health.coordinationEfficiency * 0.2 +
            (1.0 - health.blockerImpact) * 0.1)
}
```

#### Early Warning Triggers
- **Velocity Drop:** >20% decrease in daily story point completion
- **Quality Degradation:** Quality score drops below 85%
- **Coordination Issues:** >3 conflicts per day between workstreams
- **Blocker Accumulation:** >2 active blockers for any single workstream

### Adaptive Resource Allocation
**Dynamic adjustment of agent focus based on workstream health:**

```kotlin
class WorkstreamBalancer {
    fun rebalanceResources(workstreamHealth: Map<Agent, WorkstreamHealth>) {
        val strugglingWorkstreams = workstreamHealth.filter { it.value.successProbability < 0.7 }
        
        strugglingWorkstreams.forEach { (agent, health) ->
            when (health.primaryIssue) {
                IssueType.VELOCITY -> allocateAdditionalTime(agent)
                IssueType.QUALITY -> assignQualitySupport(agent)  
                IssueType.COORDINATION -> scheduleAlignmentSession(agent)
                IssueType.BLOCKERS -> prioritizeBlockerResolution(agent)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Improvement

### Learning Loop Integration  
**Each workstream incorporates lessons learned in real-time:**

#### Daily Retrospective Micro-Sessions (5 minutes each workstream)
- What worked well today?
- What could be improved?
- What will we do differently tomorrow?
- Any process adjustments needed?

#### Weekly Cross-Workstream Retrospectives (30 minutes)
- Coordination successes and challenges
- Process optimization opportunities
- Resource reallocation discussions
- Risk mitigation effectiveness review

### Process Evolution Tracking
```kotlin
data class ProcessMetric(
    val timestamp: Instant,
    val metric: String,
    val value: Double,
    val workstream: Agent,
    val improvement: Double? = null
)

class ProcessEvolution {
    fun trackImprovement(metric: ProcessMetric) {
        // Store metric
        // Calculate improvement trend
        // Trigger process updates if significant improvement detected
        // Share successful adaptations across workstreams
    }
}
```
