## Implementation Highlights

### Fatal Four Hazard Focus
The implementation prioritizes the "Fatal Four" construction hazards responsible for 60% of construction deaths:

1. **Falls (36.5% of deaths)** - 3 specialized tags covering fall protection, ladders, and scaffolds
2. **Electrocution (8.5% of deaths)** - 3 tags for lockout/tagout, electrical hazards, and power lines
3. **Struck-By (8% of deaths)** - 3 tags for crane operations, falling objects, and vehicle hazards
4. **Caught-In/Between (5% of deaths)** - 3 tags for excavation, trenching, and machinery hazards

### Compliance Scoring System
- **Score Range**: 0-100 points
- **Scoring Factors**:
  - OSHA reference completeness (30 points)
  - Format compliance (20 points)
  - Category appropriateness (25 points)
  - Fatal Four coverage (15 points)
  - Seasonal adjustments (10 points)

### Seasonal Risk Adjustments
- **Winter**: 10-40% risk increase for fall protection and PPE
- **Summer**: 10-30% risk increase for heat stress and electrical hazards
- **Spring/Fall**: 5-20% risk increase for transitional weather hazards

### ANSI Z535.5 Color Coding Compliance
