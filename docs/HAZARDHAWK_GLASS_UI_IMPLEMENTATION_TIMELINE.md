# HazardHawk Glass UI Implementation Timeline & Coordination Strategy

**Project**: Fix Glass Morphism UI Compilation & Restore Full Functionality  
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical Build Impact  
**Complexity**: HIGH - 60 Glass UI Files, Visual Effects, Performance  

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Current State**: Glass UI partially disabled with 60 files, 9 critical files in .temp_disabled_glass causing compilation failures  
**Root Cause**: API migration needed from Haze 0.9.0-beta01 to 1.6.10 despite dependencies being updated  
**Solution Strategy**: Multi-agent parallel coordination with staged rollout and performance optimization  

### Critical Success Factors
- ✅ Dependencies already updated (haze-materials 1.6.10)
- ⚠️  API migration needed for 9 disabled files  
- 🔄 Performance optimization required for 60 total glass files
- 🛡️ Construction safety features must be preserved
- 📱 Cross-device compatibility essential
