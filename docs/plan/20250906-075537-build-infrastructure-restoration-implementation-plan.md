**Implementation Timeline**: 3 Phases
- **Week 1**: Critical fixes + Security foundation (15 compilation issues + security services)
- **Weeks 2-4**: AI restoration + OSHA compliance (Gemini Vision API + audit trails) 
- **Months 1-3**: Advanced features + Performance optimization

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Specification

### 1. Minimal Component Design

Based on simple-architect agent analysis, the restoration requires these core components:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Photo Capture] --> B[Security Layer]
    B --> C[AI Analysis Pipeline]
    C --> D[OSHA Compliance Engine]
    D --> E[Audit Trail Storage]
    
    B --> F[SecureStorageService]
    B --> G[PhotoEncryptionService]
    B --> H[AuditLogger]
    
    subgraph "Cross-Platform Services"
    F --> I[Android Keystore]
    F --> J[iOS Keychain]
    G --> K[AES-256 Encryption]
    H --> L[Compliance Logging]
    end
```

### 2. Core Security Interfaces

**Priority 1: Secure Credential Storage**
```kotlin
// File: shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hazardhawk/security/SecureStorageService.kt
interface SecureStorageService {
    suspend fun storeApiKey(key: String, value: String): Result<Unit>
    suspend fun getApiKey(key: String): Result<String?>
    suspend fun removeApiKey(key: String): Result<Unit>
    suspend fun clearAllCredentials(): Result<Unit>
}
```

**Priority 2: Photo Encryption**
```kotlin
// File: shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hazardhawk/security/PhotoEncryptionService.kt
interface PhotoEncryptionService {
    suspend fun encryptPhoto(photo: ByteArray): Result<EncryptedPhoto>
    suspend fun decryptPhoto(encrypted: EncryptedPhoto): Result<ByteArray>
    fun generateEncryptionKey(): ByteArray
}
```

**Priority 3: OSHA Audit Trail**
```kotlin
// File: shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hazardhawk/security/AuditLogger.kt
interface AuditLogger {
    suspend fun logSafetyAction(action: SafetyAction): Result<Unit>
    suspend fun logComplianceEvent(event: ComplianceEvent): Result<Unit>
    suspend fun generateAuditReport(dateRange: DateRange): Result<AuditReport>
}
```

### 3. Data Flow Architecture

**Simplified Photo ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Storage Pipeline**:
1. **Capture**: Photo captured with metadata (GPS, timestamp, worker ID)
2. **Encrypt**: Local AES-256 encryption before any processing
3. **Queue**: Encrypted upload queue with retry logic
4. **Process**: AI analysis via Gemini Vision API with encrypted data
5. **Audit**: All actions logged for OSHA compliance
6. **Store**: Results stored with 5-year retention policy

### 4. Cross-Platform Implementation Strategy

**Expect/Actual Pattern for Security**:
```kotlin
// shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hazardhawk/security/SecureStorage.kt
expect class SecureStorageImpl() : SecureStorageService

// shared/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/hazardhawk/security/SecureStorageImpl.kt  
actual class SecureStorageImpl : SecureStorageService {
    // Android Keystore implementation
}

// shared/src/iosMain/kotlin/com/hazardhawk/security/SecureStorageImpl.kt
actual class SecureStorageImpl : SecureStorageService {
    // iOS Keychain implementation  
}
```

```bash
# Delightful developer commands
./gradlew restoreSecurityFoundation  # Guided security setup
./gradlew validateRestoration        # Comprehensive validation  
./gradlew generateComplianceReport   # OSHA compliance check
```

**Error Experience Design**
- Build failures include specific fix instructions
- Security configuration errors guide to resolution
- Performance regression alerts with optimization suggestions
- OSHA compliance gaps with actionable guidance

### 3. Progressive Enhancement Strategy

**Phase Rollout Communication**
```kotlin
sealed class RestorationPhase {
    object SecurityFoundation : RestorationPhase()
    object AIEnhancement : RestorationPhase()
    object ComplianceOptimization : RestorationPhase()
}

// Clear progress indicators for all stakeholders
// Transparent timeline communication
// Success celebration at each milestone
```
