## 🏛️ Technical Architecture Specification

### Core Components Architecture

Based on analysis of existing patterns from `LoveableTagDialog.kt` and construction-optimized components, the enhanced gallery will use minimal, reusable components:

```kotlin
// File: /Users/aaron/Apps Coded/HH-v0/HazardHawk/androidApp/src/main/java/com/hazardhawk/gallery/GalleryComponents.kt

@Composable
fun EnhancedPhotoThumbnail(
    photo: Photo,
    isSelected: Boolean = false,
    isMultiSelectMode: Boolean = false,
    onPhotoClick: () -> Unit,
    onSelectionChange: (Boolean) -> Unit = {},
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
)

@Composable
fun PhotoListItem(
    photo: Photo,
    isSelected: Boolean = false,
    onPhotoClick: () -> Unit,
    onSelectionChange: (Boolean) -> Unit = {},
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
)

@Composable
fun PhotoDetailScreen(
    photo: Photo,
    onBack: () -> Unit,
    onTagsEdit: () -> Unit,
    onShare: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
)
```

### State Management Design

Following existing StateFlow patterns from the tag management system:

```kotlin
// File: /Users/aaron/Apps Coded/HH-v0/HazardHawk/androidApp/src/main/java/com/hazardhawk/gallery/GalleryViewModel.kt

data class GalleryUiState(
    val photos: List<Photo> = emptyList(),
    val selectedPhotos: Set<String> = emptySet(),
    val viewMode: GalleryViewMode = GalleryViewMode.GRID,
    val currentFilter: PhotoFilter = PhotoFilter.All,
    val isLoading: Boolean = false,
    val error: String? = null,
    val isMultiSelectMode: Boolean = false
)

enum class GalleryViewMode { GRID, LIST, DETAIL }
```

#### Phase 1: Encryption Implementation
```kotlin
class SecurePhotoStorage {
    private val keyAlias = "hazardhawk_photo_encryption_key"
    
    suspend fun encryptPhotoFile(photoFile: File, sensitivityLevel: DataClassification): File {
        val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")
        val keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("AndroidKeyStore")
        val secretKey = keyStore.getKey(keyAlias, null)
        
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
        // Encrypt sensitive photos at rest
    }
}

enum class DataClassification {
    PUBLIC,           // General site photos
    INTERNAL,         // Worker photos, equipment
    CONFIDENTIAL,     // Safety incidents, violations
    RESTRICTED        // Legal/compliance evidence
}
```

#### Phase 2: GDPR Compliance
```kotlin
class GDPRPhotoProcessor {
    suspend fun detectAndBlurFaces(photo: File): ProcessedPhoto
    suspend fun obtainWorkerConsent(workerId: String): ConsentRecord
    suspend fun handleDataSubjectRequest(request: DataSubjectRequest): ComplianceResponse
}
```

### OSHA Compliance Requirements (2025)

**New PPE Documentation Standards** (Effective January 13, 2025):
- Documented proof of PPE compliance with photographic evidence
- Penalty Risk: Up to $161,323 for willful violations
- Timestamped photos showing proper PPE usage required

```kotlin
data class OSHAPhotoMetadata(
    val timestamp: Instant,
    val gpsLocation: GPSCoordinate,
    val projectId: String,
    val inspector: String,
    val complianceCategory: OSHACategory,
    val digitalSignature: String,  // Required for legal evidence
    val chainOfCustody: List<AccessLog>
)
```

- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth scale animation with orange selection indicator
- **Batch Actions**: Floating action bar with clear action counts
- **Smart Defaults**: Auto-suggest relevant photos for specific report types

#### Construction-Optimized Design
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 56dp (recommended 72dp) for gloved operation
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility for outdoor conditions
- **One-Handed Operation**: All controls accessible within thumb reach
- **Error Recovery**: Human-friendly messages with clear next steps

#### Performance That Feels Snappy
- **Progressive Loading**: Skeleton screens during photo loading

## 📊 Code Simplification & Refactoring

### Strategic Code Reduction

#### Eliminate Duplicate Code
- **Remove** `PhotoStorageManager.kt` (136 lines of deprecated wrapper)
- **Consolidate** multiple activities into navigation-based architecture
- **Extract** reusable components from inline implementations
- **Expected Savings**: ~1500 lines of duplicate/deprecated code

#### Component Extraction
```
Before (Scattered Implementation):
- CameraGalleryActivity.kt (528 lines)
- MainActivity.kt (325 lines with inline components)
- Multiple duplicate activities

After (Organized Structure):
/ui/gallery/
├── GalleryComponents.kt (200 lines)
├── GalleryViewModel.kt (150 lines)
├── PhotoGrid.kt (100 lines)
└── PhotoList.kt (100 lines)
```
