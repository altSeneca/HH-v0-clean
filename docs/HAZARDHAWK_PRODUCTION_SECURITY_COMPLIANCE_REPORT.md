**Phase:** 3.1 Security Hardening Implementation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Production Ready

## Executive Summary

HazardHawk has successfully implemented comprehensive security hardening measures to meet production deployment standards for construction safety applications. All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed, excessive permissions removed, and OSHA-compliant audit systems implemented.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Permission Cleanup ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Files Modified:** 
- `/HazardHawk/androidApp/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

**Actions Taken:**
- ❌ **REMOVED** excessive permissions:
