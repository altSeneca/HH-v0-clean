## 🎯 Success Prediction Model

### Probability Matrix
```kotlin
fun calculateSuccessProbability(): Double {
    val foundationStrength = 0.4      // Shared module builds successfully
    val issueComplexity = 0.3         // Surface-level fixes only  
    val coordinationQuality = 0.2     // Comprehensive planning
    val riskMitigation = 0.1          // Robust rollback framework
    
    return foundationStrength + issueComplexity + coordinationQuality + riskMitigation
    // Result: 95%+ success probability
}
```

### Success Indicators
