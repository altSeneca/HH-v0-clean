## Resource Optimization Strategies

### Skill Multiplier Approach
- **Security Specialist** provides security patterns that other developers can implement
- **UX Designer** creates design system enabling developers to implement consistently
- **AI Integration Lead** builds reusable components for document generation
- **Cross-Platform Specialist** creates platform-specific patterns others can follow

### Load Balancing Mechanisms
- **Overflow work**: QA Lead picks up development tasks during light testing periods
- **Cross-training**: Frontend Developer learns iOS basics to support Cross-Platform Specialist
- **Documentation**: Lower-priority team members maintain documentation while others code

### Resource Conflict Resolution
1. **Competing Priorities**: Project manager makes priority call within 4 hours
2. **Skill Bottlenecks**: Pair programming sessions to transfer knowledge
3. **Timeline Pressure**: Scope reduction rather than resource over-allocation
4. **Quality vs Speed**: Always choose quality (construction safety = zero compromise)
