## Risk Management Strategy

### High-Priority Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Critical | High | Phase 1 security-first implementation |
| **API Rate Limiting** | Medium | Medium | Intelligent caching, fallback templates |
| **AI Response Quality** | High | Low | Comprehensive prompt engineering, human review |

### Rollback Procedures
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollout (25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
- **Template fallback** if AI generation fails
- **Automated rollback triggers** for critical metrics
- **Emergency rollback** procedures tested and documented

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Blocking Quality Gates (Must Pass 100%)
1. **Security Gate 1.1** (Day 5): Certificate pinning functional
2. **Security Gate 1.2** (Day 8): Secure storage encrypted
3. **Functional Gate 1.3** (Day 10): Basic document generation working
4. **Production Gate 3.1** (Day 25): Production deployment ready
5. **Compliance Gate 3.2** (Day 28): Legal and regulatory compliance complete

### Success Metrics
- **Document Generation Speed**: <3 seconds average, <5 seconds P95
- **OSHA Compliance**: 100% of generated documents compliant
- **Security Audit**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **User Experience**: >80% task completion rate for construction workers
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: 100% feature consistency

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Confirmed Technology Stack
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro via Vertex AI
- **Security**: Certificate pinning + hardware-backed keystores
- **Cross-Platform**: Kotlin Multiplatform (existing architecture)
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (Android), SwiftUI (iOS), Compose Multiplatform (Desktop)
- **Document Generation**: Extend existing SafetyReportTemplates.kt

### Key Integration Points
