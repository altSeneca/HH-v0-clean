## Dependencies Added

Updated `/HazardHawk/androidApp/build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
// Image loading - Updated to Coil 3.0 for better performance
implementation("io.coil-kt.coil3:coil-compose:3.0.0")
implementation("io.coil-kt.coil3:coil-network-okhttp:3.0.0")
implementation("androidx.exifinterface:exifinterface:1.3.7")

// Zoom functionality for photo detail view
implementation("net.engawapg.lib:zoomable:1.6.1")
```

## Integration with ConstructionSafetyGallery

### Updated Behavior
- **Single tap on photo**: Opens PhotoDetailDialog with full-screen viewer
- **Long press on photo**: Enters multi-select mode (existing behavior)
- **In multi-select mode**: Tap toggles selection (existing behavior)

### New State Variables
```kotlin
var showPhotoDetail by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
var selectedPhotoIndex by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
```

### Photo Detail Actions
1. **Share**: Placeholder for photo sharing functionality
2. **Delete**: Placeholder for photo deletion with confirmation
3. **Generate Report**: Creates single-photo report (integrates with existing report system)
4. **Technical Details**: Shows comprehensive EXIF data panel

## Security & Privacy Features

### Privacy Compliance
- Configurable privacy settings via `PrivacySettings` data class
- GPS data sanitization based on user consent
- Optional address lookup with privacy controls
- EXIF data stripping for sharing
- No sensitive information in logs
- GDPR-compliant data handling

### Privacy Settings
```kotlin
data class PrivacySettings(
    val includeLocationData: Boolean = true,
    val includeAddressLookup: Boolean = true,
    val includeCameraSettings: Boolean = true,
    val logSensitiveData: Boolean = false
)
```
