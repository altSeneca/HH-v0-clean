## Understanding Compliance Scores

### Scoring System (0-100 points)
- **95-100**: Excellent compliance - industry leading
- **90-94**: Good compliance - meets standards
- **80-89**: Acceptable compliance - minor improvements needed
- **70-79**: Poor compliance - significant improvements required
- **<70**: Critical compliance issues - immediate action required

### Score Factors
- **OSHA Reference Completeness** (30 points): Tags have proper OSHA citations
- **Format Compliance** (20 points): References follow correct format
- **Category Appropriateness** (25 points): Tags match their safety categories
- **Fatal Four Coverage** (15 points): Adequate coverage of leading hazards
- **Seasonal Adjustments** (10 points): Risk factors for current season

## Seasonal Risk Factors

The system automatically adjusts risk levels based on seasonal conditions:

### Winter (December - February)
- **40% higher risk** for fall protection due to ice/snow
- **20% higher risk** for PPE due to cold weather gear
- Focus on slip/trip hazards and hypothermia prevention

### Spring (March - May)
- **20% higher risk** for fall protection during construction ramp-up
- **10% higher risk** for equipment safety after winter storage
- Focus on equipment inspections and training refreshers

### Summer (June - August)
- **30% higher risk** for PPE due to heat stress considerations
- **20% higher risk** for electrical hazards in wet conditions
- Focus on heat illness prevention and hydration

### Fall (September - November)

- **10% higher risk** for lighting and visibility issues
- Focus on weather protection and daylight considerations

## Common Compliance Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Missing OSHA References
**Problem**: Tags don't have proper OSHA citations
**Solution**: Use pre-configured tags or add proper references (e.g., "29 CFR 1926.501")
**Impact**: Can result in failed audits and regulatory citations

### Issue: Incorrect Severity Levels
**Problem**: Critical hazards marked as low priority
**Solution**: Use ANSI color coding - red for danger, orange for warning
**Impact**: Workers may not take appropriate precautions

### Issue: Incomplete Fatal Four Coverage
**Problem**: Project doesn't address all four leading causes of construction deaths
**Solution**: Review Fatal Four dashboard and add missing hazard tags
**Impact**: Increased risk of serious accidents and fatalities

### Issue: Outdated Compliance Information
