### 4. Updated ConstructionSafetyGallery.kt
**Location**: `/HazardHawk/androidApp/src/main/java/com/hazardhawk/ui/gallery/ConstructionSafetyGallery.kt`

**Integration Features**:
- Replaced TODO implementation (lines 342-368) with secure deletion
- Added comprehensive state management for deletion operations
- Integrated undo functionality with automatic cleanup
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- Progress tracking for batch deletion operations

## Security Implementation Details

### Audit Trail Compliance
- Every deletion attempt logged with unique audit ID
- Security events include permission denials and failures
- Sanitized file paths in logs (filename only, no sensitive directories)
- Comprehensive event types: DELETE_REQUESTED, DELETE_COMPLETED, DELETE_FAILED, PERMISSION_DENIED, UNDO_REQUESTED, UNDO_COMPLETED

### Permission Security
- Android 10+ scoped storage compatibility
- Legacy WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission validation
- Graceful permission denial handling with user guidance
- Security exceptions properly caught and logged

### File Recovery System
- **30-second undo window** with automatic expiration
- **Temporary file backup** in app-private directory
- **Automatic cleanup** of expired undo data
- **Batch undo support** for multiple file recovery
- **MediaStore re-integration** for restored files

### Error Handling
- **SecurityException**: Permission-related errors with user guidance
- **IOException**: File system errors with technical details
- **Partial failures**: Individual file failures in batch operations
- **Network failures**: MediaStore integration issues

## User Experience Features

### Construction Worker Friendly
- **Large touch targets** (minimum 56dp) for gloved hands
- **High contrast colors** for outdoor visibility
- **Haptic feedback** throughout interaction flow
- **Clear progress indicators** for long operations
- **Simple language** avoiding technical jargon

### Security UX
- **Visual warnings** with pulsing animations
- **Double confirmation** with security countdown
- **Undo notifications** with prominent action buttons
- **Progress tracking** prevents user confusion
- **Clear error messages** with actionable guidance

## OSHA Compliance Features

### Safety Documentation Protection
- **Warning dialog** highlighting compliance impact
- **Audit trail** for regulatory documentation
- **Confirmation process** prevents accidental deletion
- **Recovery window** allows mistake correction
- **Security logging** for legal requirements

### Documentation Impact Warnings
- OSHA compliance records
- Incident reports
- Safety audit trails
- Legal documentation

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management
- **Streaming deletion** prevents memory spikes
- **Automatic cleanup** of temporary files
- **Lazy loading** of file information
- **Progress callbacks** prevent UI blocking

### Background Operations
- **Coroutine-based** async operations
- **Non-blocking UI** during deletion
- **Cancellation safety** (where appropriate)
- **Memory-efficient** batch processing

## Integration Summary

The implementation successfully replaces the TODO functionality in lines 342-368 of `ConstructionSafetyGallery.kt` with:

1. **Secure deletion button** using `CompactDestructiveButton`
2. **Confirmation dialog** with two-step security process
3. **Progress tracking** during batch operations
4. **Undo snackbar** with 30-second recovery window
5. **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
6. **State management** for complex deletion workflows

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Permission handling** on different Android versions
2. **MediaStore integration** across device manufacturers
3. **Error scenarios** (insufficient storage, permission denial)
4. **Undo functionality** timing and reliability
5. **Batch operations** with large photo sets

### Security Testing
1. **Audit log verification** in production environment
2. **Permission bypass attempts** (security validation)
3. **File recovery reliability** under various conditions
4. **Memory pressure testing** during large deletions

## Production Deployment Notes

### Required Setup
1. **Audit logging destination** (encrypted file or remote service)
2. **Permission handling** configuration for target Android versions
3. **Storage optimization** for temporary file management
4. **Error reporting** integration for production monitoring

### Monitoring Requirements
1. **Deletion success rates** tracking
2. **Undo usage patterns** analysis
3. **Error frequency** monitoring
4. **Performance metrics** for batch operations

This implementation provides enterprise-grade security controls while maintaining the construction-friendly user experience required for field operations. All security requirements have been met, including proper audit trails, permission validation, and OSHA compliance features.
