# HazardHawk Mobile Tag Management - User Guide

## Quick Start Guide

### What is Tag Management?

The Mobile Tag Management System helps construction workers quickly identify and categorize safety hazards in photos. Tags are labels like "Fall Hazard", "PPE Required", or "Electrical" that make photos searchable and useful for safety reporting.

### Why Use Tags?

- **Find Photos Faster** - Search by safety category instead of scrolling
- **Create Reports** - Generate safety reports by tag type
- **Track Progress** - See which hazards are most common
- **Stay Compliant** - Follow OSHA safety documentation requirements

### Creating Custom Tags

When you need tags specific to your project or company:

#### Method 1: Search for Non-Existent Tag
1. In tag dialog, type new tag name in search bar
2. If no matches found, "Add New Tag" option appears
3. Tap "Add New Tag"
4. Choose a color for the tag
5. Tag is created and immediately available

#### Method 2: Common Custom Tags
Popular custom tags construction workers create:
- Project-specific: "Building A", "Floor 3", "East Wing"
- Company-specific: "Daily Inspection", "Supervisor Review"
- Equipment-specific: "Crane XYZ", "Scaffold Section 2"

### Understanding Tag Colors

Tags use color coding for quick visual identification:
- **🔴 Red** - High-risk safety issues (Fall Hazards, Electrical)
- **🟡 Yellow** - Caution items (PPE Required, Hot Work)
- **🔵 Blue** - Equipment/Process (Crane Operations, Inspections)
- **🟢 Green** - Housekeeping/Maintenance (Clean Up, Storage)
- **🟣 Purple** - Custom/Project-specific tags

### Tag Search Tips

**Effective Search Techniques:**
- **Partial Words**: Type "elec" to find "Electrical"
- **Categories**: Search "PPE" to find all protective equipment tags
- **OSHA Codes**: Search "1926" to find OSHA-referenced tags
- **Common Terms**: "fall", "fire", "confined" work well

### Batch Photo Management

**Workflow for Multiple Photos:**
1. Take several photos during site inspection
2. Skip tagging during capture (photos are saved)
3. Return to office or break time
4. Open Gallery → tap each untagged photo → add appropriate tags
5. All photos get properly categorized

## Best Practices for Construction Workers

### Daily Workflow

#### Pre-Shift Safety Walk
1. Take photos of any new hazards or conditions
2. Tag immediately with relevant safety categories
3. Note if hazards require immediate attention
4. Use consistent tags across the team

#### During Work
1. Photo first, tag second - safety comes first
2. If rushed, skip tagging - photo is still saved
3. Use voice notes if hands are dirty, tag later
4. Focus on hazards that affect multiple workers

#### End of Shift
1. Review gallery for untagged photos
2. Add tags while hazards are fresh in memory
3. Check that important hazards are documented
4. Share urgent issues with supervisors

### Tag Strategy

#### Use Standard Tags First
- Stick to OSHA categories when possible
- "Fall Hazard", "PPE Required", "Electrical" are universal
- Custom tags should supplement, not replace standards

#### Be Consistent
- Use same tags for similar hazards across the project
- Coordinate with team on custom tag names
- Update old photos if tag strategy changes

#### Think About Reporting
- Tag with end-use in mind (safety reports, inspections)
- More specific tags are better than generic ones
- Include both hazard type AND required action when possible
