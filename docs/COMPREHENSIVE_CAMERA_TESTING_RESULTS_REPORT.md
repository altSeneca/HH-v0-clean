**Problem:** Inconsistent positioning across different aspect ratios
**Solution:** Unified calculation logic in `UnifiedViewfinderCalculator`
- Single source of truth for all viewport calculations
- Consistent horizontal centering across all aspect ratios
- Top-aligned positioning for predictable layout

### 3. Horizontal Zoom Slider Positioning  
**Problem:** Zoom slider positioning inconsistent with viewport changes
**Solution:** Integrated with unified viewport bounds
- Slider positioning relative to calculated viewport bounds
