## Construction Worker Focused Testing

### Environmental Conditions Testing
- **Glove Operation**: Imprecise touches, minimum 56dp targets
- **Outdoor Visibility**: High contrast mode, anti-glare optimization
- **One-Handed Use**: Thumb reachability within 85% of screen
- **Dirty Hands/Screen**: Enhanced touch sensitivity validation
- **Hard Hat Restriction**: Limited head movement accommodation
- **Construction Site Noise**: Visual feedback priority over audio

### Usability Success Metrics
- **95% glove operation success rate**
- **All touch targets minimum 56dp**
- **One-handed operation within 85% screen reach**
- **Recovery from interruptions within 3 seconds**
- **High contrast mode with 4.5:1 minimum ratio**
- **Visual feedback response under 100ms**

## Performance Benchmarking Framework

### Speed & Responsiveness Targets
```kotlin
companion object {
    private const val PHOTO_VIEWER_LAUNCH_TARGET_MS = 500L      // Launch time
    private const val TAB_SWITCHING_TARGET_MS = 100L            // Tab switching
    private const val MEMORY_USAGE_TARGET_MB = 50L              // Memory usage
    private const val TOUCH_RESPONSE_TARGET_MS = 16L            // 60fps response
}
```

### Statistical Analysis Methodology
- **10+ iterations per performance test**
- **P50, P95, P99 percentile analysis**
