## Workflow Step Images

### Step 1: Capture (step-1-capture.png)
**Description**: "Show a construction worker in safety gear (hard hat, high-vis vest) holding a smartphone to photograph a safety hazard. The scene should be on an active construction site with natural lighting. Focus on the phone screen showing the camera viewfinder with construction equipment or scaffolding in view. Include metadata overlay elements (GPS coordinates, timestamp). Professional photography style, warm lighting, authentic construction environment."

### Step 2: Analyze (step-2-analyze.png)
**Description**: "Display a smartphone screen showing AI analysis results. The interface should show a construction photo with AI-generated safety analysis overlays - colored boxes around hazards, OSHA code callouts (like '1926.95 - Personal Protective Equipment'), confidence scores, and severity indicators. Use clean UI design with the HazardHawk color scheme. Show multiple hazards detected with different priority levels (red for high risk, yellow for medium, green for compliant)."

### Step 3: Document (step-3-document.png)
**Description**: "Show a professional safety report PDF on a tablet screen. The report should contain the analyzed photo with embedded hazard callouts, OSHA compliance details, recommendations, and digital signature area.
