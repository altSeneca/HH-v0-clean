### 1. **Objective**

To create a scalable, AI-driven platform for identifying, analyzing, and managing safety hazards on construction sites. HazardHawk will streamline compliance, improve safety culture, and reduce incident rates using automated image and text analysis aligned with OSHA standards. It should be easy for users to snap a photo, add safety tags 

The final product is always a simple, lovable, complete application capable of delighting users with how well thought out the UX and UI are. We are building for construction crews who do not have time to learn a new app, everything must be easy to find and easy to accomplish.

  * Severity ratings
  * Postive observations
* **Result Handling:**

  * JSON analysis results are paired with each image
  * Stored in the user's gallery
  * Exportable as a printable report (PDF), containing:

    * Each photo
